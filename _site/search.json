Based on different questions we are going to solve, we decided each person will take one question to analyze and then combine the analysis all together at the end.\nOutcome: Team prioritized the following analytical goals:\n\n\nInfluence Network: Who influenced Sailor, and whom has she influenced directly or indirectly?\nCollaborations: Who are her most frequent collaborators across time and genres?\nGenre Flow: How has Oceanus Folk spread across the global music network?\nTemporal Dynamics: Did the influence of Oceanus Folk rise gradually or intermittently?\nGenre Evolution: How has Oceanus Folk itself changed under Sailor’s influence?\nRising Star Profile: What patterns (e.g., collaborations, genre shifts, notoriety timing) define an artist’s rise?\n\nForecasting: Predict the next three potential Oceanus Folk stars using network position and career paths.\n\nTechnical Challenges and Considerations Action: Identified data cleaning and modeling tasks.\n\nOutcome:\n\nClean missing or malformed IDs in from and tofields.\nHarmonize time fields and assign year-based bins for temporal analysis.\nCategorize and recode Edge Types into weighted influence scores.\nValidate node uniqueness and remove duplicates.\n\nNext Steps Refine the visual storytelling narrative using exploratory findings.\n\nAlign each visualization with one or more of the challenge questions.\nBegin drafting poster components with annotated visuals and insights.\n\nNext Meeting Scheduled: 5th- June( 8 pm- 9 pm)"
