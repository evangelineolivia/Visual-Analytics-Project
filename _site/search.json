    "section": "2 Oceanus Folk Trends",
    "text": "2 Oceanus Folk Trends\nNow we will see some insights from how the trends of Oceanus folk goes\n\n2.1 2023 Marked as the Peak of Oceanus Folk Relases\n\n\n\n\n\nShort view, the number of releases is definitely seen growing, especially from 2010, and it reached its peak in 2023. After that, the number starts to go down, which might indicate the period when Oceanus Folk reached its peak popularity.\nOne thing that’s very clear is that the number of songs dominates compared to albums. In terms of the number of releases, it’s not stable across the years. Some years like 2013, 2017, 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2029 had more than 15 releases, while the years in between had a very small number.\nSo, the question is, is it only a few artists who released Oceanus Folk songs, and they were not consistent? Which might mean Oceanus Folk is not their main genre? Or, another possible interpretation: Oceanus Folk could be a genre that artists explore occasionally, maybe depending on trend, theme, or collaboration.\nWhile if we look at the number of releases after 2023 (where the peak happened) although the trend is going down, for a few years, the numbers are not that small. There were still quite a few songs under the Oceanus Folk genre for at least 8 more years.\nAlthough at a glance we can say the trend is starting to fade, from a different angle, we can see that Oceanus Folk still influences some artists in different ways, not just directly as an Oceanus Folk release, but by inspiring other genres as well. Which connects to the observation below.\n\n\n2.2 Most of the songs influenced by Oceanus Folk are inspired by the Style of Oceanus Folk\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we learned that 2010 is the starting point where Oceanus Folk started to make more contribution, 2023 is where it reaches the peak. This finding can explain the reasons, we can see the trends before it reached that important year. A few years before, there were already more songs that are inspired by Oceanus Folk.\nThis graph might also answer the above confusion about what happened to Oceanus Folk, and how it maintained its influence in the music industry. Even after that, the number of songs “in style of” still maintains quite a few numbers. But we still see a very deep drop at 2023, which can’t give us a clear reason for what happened to Oceanus Folk influences.\n\n\n2.3 Oceanus Folk Has Made Its Influence on Other Genres\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile from this finding, we can see that Oceanus Folk has made its way to influence quite a number of songs, and the genres are also very diverse.\n\nAbove is the top 5 genres (ordered by number of releases) out of 16 genres, with Desert Rock being in the first place, producing 50 songs that are influenced by Oceanus Folk songs. Meanwhile, Dream Pop and Indie Folk follow next, each with 42 releases. This can also tell us that Oceanus Folk has influenced genres with very different characteristics.\n\n\n2.4 Most Oceanus Folk inspirations come from Indie Folk\n \nFrom the roots graph, we can actually see two different ways of how Oceanus Folk was influenced. There’s a dense part in the middle, where some Oceanus Folk songs seem to be connected to many others, this could mean that they were not just influenced by one genre, but maybe by multiple ones. And at the same time, those songs might also influence other Oceanus Folk songs too, forming that strong web in the center.\nMeanwhile, on the outer edges of the graph, we can see a few Oceanus Folk songs that are influenced in a more one-to-one way, maybe just by a single song or artist from a different genre. These are not very connected to the main cluster, so it looks like they were influenced independently.\nNow the question is, what genre has the most influence on Oceanus Folk?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is Indie Folk from the table, we can see there are 50 songs under Indie Folk that have influenced Oceanus Folk songs. This can explained that there is strong connection between the two genres. And It’s actually not really surprising, since both share similar elements like acoustic sounds, emotional tone, and storytelling style."

    "text": "3 Who will be the Next Star?\nAlthough from the findings, Sailor Shift is far ahead in terms of volume and impact, we can see that Beatrice Albright and Daniel O’Connell are next following Sailor. With 8 of their recent works all being top-charted, their consistency in quality can be one factor that makes them stand out as emerging rising stars. We highlight this in comparison with some other artists, where the ratio of top-charted songs to number of releases is lower.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand this better, in the next part we can also see the comparison of these three artists in terms of activity, contribution, collaboration, and public recognition.\n \nFrom the current predicted artists to be the next star, it turns out that Beatrice Albright and Daniel O’Connell are part of the same musical group, and the number of their releases is pretty similar, with some being solo works. From here, we can learn that the next star doesn’t always have to be a solo artist, but can also come from a musical group.\nWhile, another artist, Orla Seabloom, also has a pretty decent number of releases. But it’s worth noting that most of her releases happened around 2029, and she hasn’t released much after that.\nSince we see potential from Beatrice Albright and Daniel O’Connell, then we will take a look at their career as collaborators.\n \nFrom the graph, we can see that both of them are strongly connected to few number of collaborators. Not just through their musical group (Copper Canyon Ghosts) but there are also several works they’ve contributed to together. For example, both of them are involved in Tide-Worn Tales and The Sunken Compass.\nMoreover, Beatrice also has worked with Sailor Shift in Tidesworn Ballads, while Daniel is connected to Sailor Shift through Submerged Sonatas. From this shared works, it is possible that tehir positions within the Oceanus Folk community shows that collaboration could be one of the reasons they’re emerging as rising stars."

It captures a multi-dimensional view of artistic potential by evaluating the following core components:\n\nCreative Activity\nRegular releases suggest momentum and consistency.\nCreative Contribution\nArtists who engage in composition, production, or lyrics.\nCollaboration\nAny other person who is connected to the same song(s) as the artist via a creative roles.\nPublic Recognition\nWhile not the only sign of influence, chart performance remains a strong indicator of public recognition.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Rising Star Score\nWe designed a composite Rising Star Score to quantify future potential. It includes the following weighted components:\n\nTotal Works\nReflects productivity and output volume.\nCharted Ratio (highly weighted)\nMeasures public recognition; greater weight emphasizes impact over quantity.\nCollaboration Count\nIndicates the artist’s engagement in the music community.\nCreative Contributions\nCaptures behind-the-scenes roles (e.g., producer, lyricist, composer).\nFreshness Adjustment\nPenalizes artists who have not released new work recently, even if they debuted early."
