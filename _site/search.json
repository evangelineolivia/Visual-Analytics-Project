Module Prototyping Progress Review\nAction: Each member shared updates on the module they are individually developing as part of the Mini-Challenge 1 prototype.\nDiscussion:\n\nAll members confirmed progress in module coding and visualization.\nXinyi focused on implementing temporal influence dynamics using centrality scores over time.\nEvangeline explored artists in the network and used a scoring system based on their collaborations, creative roles, and charted works to predict which ones are most likely to become rising stars.\nPatricia explored visualizing collaboration density and node degree for genre evolution tracking.\n\nOutcome: Modules are progressing well, and all team members are on track to finalize them before integration.\n\n\n2. Shiny App Integration Planning\nAction: Planned how individual prototype modules will be integrated into the final Shiny application.\nDiscussion:\n\nAgreed to use a tab-based interface where each tab represents one analytical module.\nDecided to define shared data inputs at the global level (server.R) and reuse across modules.\nDiscussed standardizing visual styling and color palettes for a consistent interface.\n\nOutcome: Integration strategy confirmed. Final modules will be modularized using moduleServer() and UI() structure for Shiny compatibility.\n\n\n3. Set up a shared Git repository for version control and backup.\nNext Steps\n\nFinalize each module individually.\nBegin layout design of the poster over the weekend.\nSchedule dry run of full Shiny app by 10th June.\n\nNext Meeting Scheduled: Monday, 16th June (7:00 pm – 8:00 pm)"

Based on different questions we are going to solve, we decided each person will take one question to analyze and then combine the analysis all together at the end.\nOutcome: Team prioritized the following analytical goals:\n\n\nInfluence Network: Who influenced Sailor, and whom has she influenced directly or indirectly?\nCollaborations: Who are her most frequent collaborators across time and genres?\nGenre Flow: How has Oceanus Folk spread across the global music network?\nTemporal Dynamics: Did the influence of Oceanus Folk rise gradually or intermittently?\nGenre Evolution: How has Oceanus Folk itself changed under Sailor’s influence?\nRising Star Profile: What patterns (e.g., collaborations, genre shifts, notoriety timing) define an artist’s rise?\n\nForecasting: Predict the next three potential Oceanus Folk stars using network position and career paths.\n\nTechnical Challenges and Considerations Action: Identified data cleaning and modeling tasks.\n\nOutcome:\n\nClean missing or malformed IDs in from and tofields.\nHarmonize time fields and assign year-based bins for temporal analysis.\nCategorize and recode Edge Types into weighted influence scores.\nValidate node uniqueness and remove duplicates.\n\nNext Steps Refine the visual storytelling narrative using exploratory findings.\n\nAlign each visualization with one or more of the challenge questions.\nBegin drafting poster components with annotated visuals and insights.\n\nNext Meeting Scheduled: 5th- June( 8 pm- 9 pm)"

    "text": "In the rapidly evolving music industry, understanding how artists rise to fame and how genres expand their influence is a complex challenge. The story of Sailor Shift, a once-local Oceanus Folk singer who rose to global superstardom, offers a unique opportunity for us to examine this phenomenon. Her career not only redefined what it means to be a successful artist but also played a pivotal role in bringing the Oceanus Folk genre to international prominence."

    "text": "4.4 Centrality & Prediction\nTo identify key figures and forecast potential breakout artists, we computed centrality metrics on the constructed network:\n\n4.4.1 Centrality Measures\nWe focused on the following network centrality indicators:\n\nDegree Centrality: measures the number of direct connections an artist has, indicating collaboration frequency or direct influence.\nBetweenness Centrality: quantifies how often an artist acts as a bridge in the network, highlighting their role in connecting different groups or genres.\nPageRank: reflects both the number and quality of connections, emphasizing artists who are connected to other influential nodes.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Defining a Rising Star\nThe prediction model goes beyond measuring popularity alone. It captures a multi-dimensional view of artistic potential by evaluating the following core components:\n\nCreative Activity\nRegular releases suggest momentum and consistency.\nCreative Contribution\nArtists who engage in composition, production, or lyrics.\nCollaboration\nAny other person who is connected to the same song(s) as the artist via a creative roles.\nPublic Recognition\nWhile not the only sign of influence, chart performance remains a strong indicator of public recognition.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Rising Star Score\nWe designed a composite Rising Star Score to quantify future potential. It includes the following weighted components:\n\nTotal Works\nReflects productivity and output volume.\nCharted Ratio (highly weighted)\nMeasures public recognition; greater weight emphasizes impact over quantity.\nCollaboration Count\nIndicates the artist’s engagement in the music community.\nCreative Contributions\nCaptures behind-the-scenes roles (e.g., producer, lyricist, composer).\nFreshness Adjustment\nPenalizes artists who have not released new work recently, even if they debuted early."
