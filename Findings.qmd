## Sailor's Career

### Overview of Sailor's Career Journey

![](/image/image2.png){fig-align="center" width="468"}

### More Singles than Albums

-   2031 marked as a special year with only published albums.

-   In a few notable years, there were no records of her release (2027, 2029, 2033, 2035, 2039).

### Collaboration

Performer Of — while she performed with others, there weren’t many records of collaboration. However, as a performer, she also participated in lyric-making, such as her work with Kia Reynold and Beatrice Albright.

Sailor also contributed quite a lot as a lyricist for a few albums (shown as red nodes).

**What happened in 2031?**

Since we noticed that in 2031 she seemed to focus more on album production, we wanted to check its relevance — who she might have collaborated with and what role she played.

It turns out she worked on four projects — as both a lyric composer and performer. This is more than in other years, where she usually worked on just one or two.

### Influence

| Interpolates | Directly Samples |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

There are only few of artists who recorded to be directly sampled her and or referenced her lyrics. However, for other types of influence — including interpolations, covers, and in-style inspirations — there are a few more, spread across both group artists and solo performers.

This means that her influence is quite diverse. Although not massive in number, it shows that Sailor has made a some contribution in Oceanus Folk through her music — especially in inspiring others in terms of style and creative covers.

While if we look again to those who in style of Sailor's music, the type of genre is also quite diverse — not just confined to Oceanus Folk, but cover out into other styles as well (as seen from the list under Genre).

## Oceanus Folk Trends

Now we will see some insights from how the trends of Oceanus folk goes

### 2023 Marked as the Peak of Oceanus Folk Relases

![](/image/image12.png){fig-align="center" width="511"}

Short view, the number of releases is definitely seen growing, especially from 2010, and it reached its peak in 2023. After that, the number starts to go down, which might indicate the period when Oceanus Folk reached its peak popularity.

One thing that’s very clear is that the number of songs dominates compared to albums. In terms of the number of releases, it's not stable across the years. Some years like 2013, 2017, 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2029 had more than 15 releases, while the years in between had a very small number.

So, the question is, is it only a few artists who released Oceanus Folk songs, and they were not consistent? Which might mean Oceanus Folk is not their main genre? Or, another possible interpretation: Oceanus Folk could be a genre that artists explore occasionally, maybe depending on trend, theme, or collaboration.

While if we look at the number of releases after 2023 (where the peak happened) although the trend is going down, for a few years, the numbers are not that small. There were still quite a few songs under the Oceanus Folk genre for at least 8 more years.

Although at a glance we can say the trend is starting to fade, from a different angle, we can see that Oceanus Folk still influences some artists in different ways, not just directly as an Oceanus Folk release, but by inspiring other genres as well. Which connects to the observation below.

### Most of the songs influenced by Oceanus Folk are inspired by the **Style** of Oceanus Folk

![](/image/image13.png){fig-align="center" width="423"}

While we learned that 2010 is the starting point where Oceanus Folk started to make more contribution, 2023 is where it reaches the peak. This finding can explain the reasons, we can see the trends before it reached that important year. A few years before, there were already more songs that are inspired by Oceanus Folk.

This graph might also answer the above confusion about what happened to Oceanus Folk, and how it maintained its influence in the music industry. Even after that, the number of songs “in style of” still maintains quite a few numbers. But we still see a very deep drop at 2023, which can’t give us a clear reason for what happened to Oceanus Folk influences.

### Oceanus Folk Has Made Its Influence on Other Genres

While from this finding, we can see that Oceanus Folk has made its way to influence quite a number of songs, and the genres are also very diverse.

\
Above is the top 5 genres (ordered by number of releases) out of 16 genres, with Desert Rock being in the first place, producing 50 songs that are influenced by Oceanus Folk songs. Meanwhile, Dream Pop and Indie Folk follow next, each with 42 releases. This can also tell us that Oceanus Folk has influenced genres with very different characteristics.

### Most Oceanus Folk inspirations come from Indie Folk

From the roots graph, we can actually see two different ways of how Oceanus Folk was influenced. There’s a dense part in the middle, where some Oceanus Folk songs seem to be connected to many others, this could mean that they were not just influenced by one genre, but maybe by multiple ones. And at the same time, those songs might also influence other Oceanus Folk songs too, forming that strong web in the center.

Meanwhile, on the outer edges of the graph, we can see a few Oceanus Folk songs that are influenced in a more one-to-one way, maybe just by a single song or artist from a different genre. These are not very connected to the main cluster, so it looks like they were influenced independently.

**Now the question is, what genre has the most influence on Oceanus Folk?**

![](/image/image%2016.png){fig-align="center"}

The answer is **Indie Folk** from the table, we can see there are 50 songs under Indie Folk that have influenced Oceanus Folk songs. This can explained that there is strong connection between the two genres. And It’s actually not really surprising, since both share similar elements like acoustic sounds, emotional tone, and storytelling style.

## Who will be the Next Star?

Although from the findings, Sailor Shift is far ahead in terms of volume and impact, we can see that Beatrice Albright and Daniel O'Connell are next following Sailor. With 8 of their recent works all being top-charted, their consistency in quality can be one factor that makes them stand out as emerging rising stars.

![](/image/image33.png){fig-align="center" width="389"}

To understand this better, in the next part we can also see the comparison of these two artists in terms of activity, contribution, collaboration, and public recognition.

![](/image/image21.png){width="45%"} ![](/image/image22.png){width="45%"}

From the current predicted artists to be the next star, it turns out that Beatrice Albright and Daniel O'Connell are part of the same musical group, and the number of their releases is pretty similar, with some being solo works. From here, we can learn that the next star doesn't always have to be a solo artist, but can also come from a musical group.

While, another artist, Orla Seabloom, also has a pretty decent number of releases. But it’s worth noting that most of her releases happened around 2029, and she hasn't released much after that.

Since we see potential from Beatrice Albright and Daniel O’Connell, then we will take a look at their career as collaborators.

![](/image/image30.png){width="45%"} ![](/image/image31.png){width="45%"}

From the graph, we can see that both of them are strongly connected to few number of collaborators. Not just through their musical group (Copper Canyon Ghosts) but there are also several works they’ve contributed to together. For example, both of them are involved in Tide-Worn Tales and The Sunken Compass.

Moreover, Beatrice also has worked with Sailor Shift in Tidesworn Ballads, while Daniel is connected to Sailor Shift through Submerged Sonatas. From this shared works, it is possible that tehir positions within the Oceanus Folk community shows that collaboration could be one of the reasons they’re emerging as rising stars.
